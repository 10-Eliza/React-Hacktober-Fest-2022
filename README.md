Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the `code` button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.

Open Git Bash and run the following git command:

```
git clone url 
```

where url  is the url you just copied! (your fork of this project).
For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/React-Hacktober-Fest-2022.git
```

where `username` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the `React-Hacktober-Fest-2022` repository on GitHub to your computer.  
  
## Make Necessary changes

Open up the project in your favourite text editor, inside the `Hack Here` create a new folder with your name and add your file. Make sure to save the edits.

Try adding a  ```Readme.md``` file. This should contain a brief description of the projects in the folder.

## Add and Commit your changes

Open Git Bash, navigate to the project directory and execute the command ```git status```, you'll see there are changes.
 Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add filename
```
You can also add all the unstaged files using : ```git add .```  

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:


```
git commit -m "commit message"
```
       
## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin main
```

## Create a pull request
  
Open the main page of your repository on your GitHub account in your browser and click on the Pull requests tab.  
Now, click on the New Pull Request button.  
Click Create Pull Request option. Enter a suitable title and description for the pull request. Now submit the pull request.
